AuthBoss
    - Basic implementation
    - Tennant aware (register by domain, email sender, view, etc)

OAuth2 server
    - Basic implementation & polymorphic relationship (?)

GRPC
    - OAuth2 Auth middleware. Inject User (Account & Tenant) into context. gRPC-Gateway forward the 'authentication' header as meta-data. JWT token!
        Scopes compare 
    - Request Id from context (& One for HTTP for Gateway's logs?)
        Gateway middleware Pass 'x-request-id' header as metadata
        Generate if doesn't exists
